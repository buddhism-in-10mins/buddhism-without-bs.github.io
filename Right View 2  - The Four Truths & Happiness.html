<blockquote>
<p>... The pleasure and happiness that arise from these five kinds of sensual stimulation is called sensual pleasure—a filthy  (<em>milha</em> = piss!), ordinary, ignoble pleasure. Such pleasure should not be cultivated or developed, but should be feared, I say.</p>
<p>Take a mendicant who, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption … second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>This is called the pleasure of renunciation, the pleasure of seclusion, the pleasure of peace, the pleasure of awakening (<em>sambodhasukhaṁ</em>). Such pleasure should be cultivated and developed, and should not be feared, I say.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Suppose, Māgandiya, <strong>there was a leper with sores and blisters on his limbs, being devoured by worms, scratching the scabs off the openings of his wounds with his nails, cauterising his body over a burning charcoal pit. Then his friends and companions, his kinsmen and relatives, brought a physician to treat him.</strong> The physician would make medicine for him, and <strong>by means of that medicine the man would be cured of his leprosy and would become well and happy, independent, master of himself, able to go where he likes. Then two strong men would seize him by both arms and drag him towards a burning charcoal pit. What do you think, Māgandiya? Would that man twist his body this way and that?”</strong></p>
<p>“Yes, Master Gotama. Why is that? Because that fire is indeed painful to touch, hot, and scorching.”</p>
<p>“What do you think, Māgandiya? Is it only now that that fire is painful to touch, hot, and scorching, or previously too was that fire painful to touch, hot, and scorching?”</p>
<p>“Master Gotama, <strong>that fire is now painful to touch, hot, and scorching, and previously too that fire was painful to touch, hot, and scorching.</strong> For when that man was a leper with sores and blisters on his limbs, being devoured by worms, scratching the scabs off the openings of his wounds with his nails, <strong>his faculties were impaired; thus, though the fire was actually painful to touch, he acquired a mistaken perception of it as pleasant</strong>.”</p>
<p>“So too, Māgandiya, <strong>in the past</strong> sensual pleasures were painful to touch, hot, and scorching; <strong>in the future sensual pleasures will be painful to touch, hot, and scorching; and now at present sensual pleasures are painful to touch, hot, and scorching</strong>. But these beings who are not free from lust for sensual pleasures, who are devoured by craving for sensual pleasures, who burn with fever for sensual pleasures, have faculties that are impaired; thus, though sensual pleasures are actually painful to touch, <strong>they acquire a mistaken perception of them as pleasant.</strong></p>

<h4 id="discussion">Discussion</h4>
<p>The Four Truths might give an impression that Buddhism is all about suffering. But Truth number 3 is talking about ending ALL suffering... and if you don't suffer, what is the opposite of suffering? Happiness (or contentment, or peace)!</p>
<p>Hence, my teacher Ajahn Brahm has suggested this re-ordering of the Four Truths</p>
<ol>
<li>There is happiness (i.e. ending of suffering)</li>
<li>There is the way leading to happiness (i.e. Eightfold Path)</li>
<li>There is the absence of happiness (i.e. suffering)</li>
<li>There is the cause of the absence of happiness (i.e. origin of suffering)
This is, imo, also a valid way of looking at the Four Truths.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, the Buddha in the EBTs often talks about the happiness &amp; pleasure outside of the five senses: the term kāmma specifically refers to the realm of the five senses of seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and touching. It does NOT refer to the realm nor pleasures solely of the sixth sense of the mind. (Note: sexual fantasies do not belong to the sixth sense of the mind, as the origins and the perceptions are from the five-sense world). Repeatedly, the Buddha criticizes the pleasures of the five-sense world, but praises the cultivation of the pleasure of this sixth-sense, which one only experiences in the four jhanas (more in future).</p>
