<blockquote>
<p>“And what is the noble eightfold path?
<em>“Katamo ca, bhikkhave, ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo?</em></p>
<p>It is right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.
<em>Seyyathidaṁ—sammādiṭṭhi …pe… sammāsamādhi.</em></p>
<p>And what is right view?
<em>Katamā ca, bhikkhave, sammādiṭṭhi?</em></p>
<p>Knowing about suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.
<em>Yaṁ kho, bhikkhave, dukkhe ñāṇaṁ, dukkhasamudaye ñāṇaṁ, dukkhanirodhe ñāṇaṁ, dukkhanirodhagāminiyā paṭipadāya ñāṇaṁ—</em></p>
<p>This is called right view.

<p><strong>First Noble Truth - suffering exists</strong>
 &gt;“Now this, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of suffering: birth is suffering, aging is suffering, illness is suffering, death is suffering; union with what is displeasing is suffering; separation from what is pleasing is suffering; not to get what one wants is suffering; in brief, the five aggregates subject to clinging are suffering.&quot;<br>

<p><strong>Second Noble Truth - craving/wanting causes suffering</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now this, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the origin of suffering: it is this craving which leads to renewed existence, accompanied by delight and lust, seeking delight here and there; that is, craving for sensual pleasures, craving for existence, craving for extermination.

<p><strong>Third Noble Truth - when craving/wanting ends, suffering ends</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now this, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering: it is the remainderless fading away and cessation of that same craving, the giving up and relinquishing of it, freedom from it, nonreliance on it.

<p><strong>Fourth Noble Truth - the Path leading to the end of suffering</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now this, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering: it is this Noble Eightfold Path;that is, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration (<em>samadhi</em>).<br>
<em>(Note: <em>samadhi</em> has been translated as 'concentration'. Other alternatives that are more aligned with the modern understanding of the term <em>samadhi</em> are: collectedness of mind, stillness [which is aligned with the Chinese translation], calmness).</em>

<h4 id="discussion">Discussion</h4>
<p>If you remember from the Introduction, the Four Truths and Eightfold Path are mutually recursive. The first factor of the Eightfold Path is Right View. In turn, a central aspect of Right View is the Four Truths.</p>
<p>The Four Truths are frequently phrased in this order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Knowledge of suffering</li>
<li>The origin of suffering lies with wanting or craving</li>
<li>The cessation (or ending) of suffering</li>
<li>The way leading to the ending of suffering, which is the Eightfold Path.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Four Truths is actually a very powerful diagnostic framework:</p>
<ol>
<li>The problem</li>
<li>The cause of the problem</li>
<li>What happens when the problem disappears</li>
<li>The way to remove the problem
The Four Truths as a diagnostic framework  is very powerful in troubleshooting your suffering: <strong>if you're suffering, that must mean you are wanting or craving something! And if you remove or let go of that wanting or craving, then your suffering will disappear</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>One thing to note is the <em><strong>definition</strong></em> of suffering. The definition of suffering includes important life milestones (birth, ageing, illness, death), but also two important mental aspects</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;union with what is displeasing is suffering;&quot; - i.e. being forced to be with something or someone unpleasant or dislikeable</li>
<li>&quot;separation from what is pleasing is suffering;&quot; - i.e. being forced apart from something or someone pleasant or beloved</li>
<li>&quot;not to get what one wants is suffering;&quot; - this should be self-evident!</li>
</ul>
<p>This suffering is caused because we want or crave: that's the Second Noble Truth. The Pali word for wanting/craving is <em>tanha</em>, which literally translates as <strong>thirst</strong>. And if you're in the flood of desire, the craving or wanting does fill one up with the same urgency, like a parched throat driving one towards drinking water.</p>
<p>The third Noble Truth points to the fact that, when we don't have this thirst, this wanting or craving, suffering ends. This can be quite simply demonstrated to you with a simple mental exercise, which is listed below: I encourage you to try this out for yourself.</p>
<p>What is slightly missing from the English translation are the <strong>four ways of letting go of craving/wanting/thirst</strong>, explained in this Third Noble Truth.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>caga</em> - generosity</li>
<li><em>patinissiga</em> - giving things up</li>
<li><em>vimutti</em> - to be free of things</li>
<li><em>analayo</em> - to not let things stick (to one's mind)</li>
</ul>
<p>The last Noble Truth, that the Eightfold Path leads to the ending of suffering, is something which needs time and patience in order for one to experience and see for oneself.</p>

<h4 id="suggested-reflection-questions--exercises">Suggested Reflection Questions &amp; Exercises</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Third Noble Truth exercise:
Take a moment to recall the happiest moments of your life.</p>
<p>Bring yourself back to those moments.</p>
<p>Now, ask yourself: <em><strong>in those moments, did you want to be anywhere else? Did you want anything else? What did you want, if at all?</strong></em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What things are you attached to?
Take one of the things you are attached to,</strong> and try giving it to someone else (sincerely!) as a gift. Notice how do you feel before and after giving the gift.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What suffering do you have right now?
<strong>What do you want or crave, that is causing your suffering?</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
