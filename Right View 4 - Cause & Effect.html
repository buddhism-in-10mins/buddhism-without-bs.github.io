<p>He has right view, undistorted vision, thus:
<em>Sammādiṭṭhiko kho pana hoti aviparītadassano:</em></p>
<p>‘There is what is given and what is offered and what is sacrificed; there is fruit and result of good and bad actions; there is this world and the other world; there is mother and father; there are beings who are reborn spontaneously; there are good and virtuous recluses and brahmins in the world who have themselves realised by direct knowledge and declare this world and the other world.'
<em>‘atthi dinnaṁ atthi yiṭṭhaṁ atthi hutaṁ, atthi sukatadukkaṭānaṁ kammānaṁ phalaṁ vipāko, atthi ayaṁ loko atthi paro loko, atthi mātā atthi pitā, atthi sattā opapātikā, atthi loke samaṇabrāhmaṇā sammaggatā sammāpaṭipannā ye imañca lokaṁ parañca lokaṁ sayaṁ abhiññā sacchikatvā pavedentī’ti.</em>

<p>何等為正見？謂說有施、有說、有齋，有善行、有惡行，有善惡行果報，有此世、有他世，有父母、有眾生生，有阿羅漢善到、善向，有此世、他世自知作證具足住：『我生已盡，梵行已立，所作已作，自知不受後有。』

<ul>
<li>This excerpt from MN 41 is another interpretation of Right View. It first starts with <em>generosity</em>: by giving, that starts off a chain of good effects.</li>
<li>Next, Right View is defined as realizing that there <em>are</em> 'fruits' (aka effects) from 'actions' (aka causes). This is basically <strong>karma</strong>, and will be covered more when we cover the Second Factor of the Eightfold Path, Right Motivation.</li>
<li>A note here: <strong>if you don't believe in karma, if you don't believe in cause-and-effect, then there is no point in being a Buddhist, and in doing good of any sort!</strong> Why? Because then, no matter what you do, your consequence is already pre-determined or it has no <strong>effect</strong> whatsoever.</li>
<li>But thankfully, that isn't reality: you <strong>can</strong> shape your path forward, by shaping your motivations &amp; intentions, and by taking the right actions of body, speech and mind. We will cover those in the next two classes.</li>
<li>The summary bullet points of this alternative interpretation of Right View is the belief in the existence of:
<ul>
<li>giving and generosity</li>
<li>effects due to good &amp; bad causes</li>
<li>this world, and other worlds</li>
<li>parents</li>
<li>beings who are reborn spontaneously</li>
<li>enlightened beings</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Take a moment to consider who is the most generous person you know. <strong>What was the last act of generosity that you recall from this person?</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now, take a moment to consider your own past acts of generosity. <strong>When was the last time you gave to someone else?</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What <strong>small thing or act can you do in the <em>next hour</em> for someone else</strong>?</p>
