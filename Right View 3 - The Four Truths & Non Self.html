<blockquote>
<p>And why do you call it <strong>form</strong>? It’s deformed; that’s why it’s called ‘form’. Deformed by what? Deformed by cold, heat, hunger, and thirst, and deformed by the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles. It’s deformed; that’s why it’s called ‘form’.</p>
<p>And why do you call it <strong>feeling</strong>? It feels; that’s why it’s called ‘feeling’. And what does it feel? It feels pleasure, pain, and neutral. It feels; that’s why it’s called ‘feeling’.</p>
<p>And why do you call it <strong>perception</strong>? It perceives; that’s why it’s called ‘perception’. And what does it perceive? It perceives blue, yellow, red, and white. It perceives; that’s why it’s called ‘perception’.</p>
<p>And why do you call them <strong>choices (sankhara)</strong>? Choices produce conditioned phenomena; that’s why they’re called ‘choices’. And what are the conditioned phenomena that they produce? Form is a conditioned phenomenon; choices are what make it into form. Feeling is a conditioned phenomenon; choices are what make it into feeling. Perception is a conditioned phenomenon; choices are what make it into perception. Choices are conditioned phenomena; choices are what make them into choices. Consciousness is a conditioned phenomenon; choices are what make it into consciousness. Choices produce conditioned phenomena; that’s why they’re called ‘choices’.</p>
<p>And why do you call it <strong>consciousness</strong>? It cognizes; that’s why it’s called ‘consciousness’. And what does it cognize? It cognizes sour, bitter, pungent, sweet, hot, mild, salty, and bland. It cognizes; that’s why it’s called ‘consciousness’.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...but what are name and form? What is their origin, their cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation? Feeling, perception, intention, contact, and attention—this is called name. The four primary elements, and form derived from the four primary elements—this is called form. Such is name and such is form. This is called name and form. Name and form originate from consciousness. Name and form cease when consciousness ceases. The practice that leads to the cessation of name and form is simply this noble eightfold path …”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...Just as two sheaves of reeds might stand leaning against each other, so too, with name-and-form as condition, consciousness comes to be; with consciousness as condition, name-and-form comes to be. With name-and-form as condition, the six sense bases come to be; with the six sense bases as condition, contact…. Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering.</p>

<h4 id="discussion">Discussion</h4>
<p>What exactly is suffering and what suffers? Who is the &quot;you&quot; who suffers?
- Five Aggregates - the five &quot;things&quot; that we view as our Self!
- Form - physical body
- Feeling - sense, good, bad, neutral. Each is different: smelly, fragrant, neutral vs. yummy, yucky, meh.
- Perception - seeing the aspects of the object e.g. blue, pink, etc.
- Volitional formations - will, including choice, decisions.
- Consciousness - the turning on of each sense organ's counterpart in the mind
How do these five aggregates relate with each other? Collectively, they are both name-and-form, and consciousness. (This is a point of confusion, because certain schools have included consciousness in name-and-form, but this passage is repeated in both the Pali and the Chinese)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>... and how name-and-form (aka feeling, perception, intention/sankhara, contact, attention, form) and consciousness interact with each other, is the famous simile of two sheaves of reeds:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If X is truly your self, then you won't suffer, because you can fully control it by wishing! That is why...</p>
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>“Any kind of feeling whatsoever … Any kind of perception whatsoever … Any kind of volitional formations whatsoever … Any kind of consciousness whatsoever, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, all consciousness should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So the Buddha is saying life is suffering, because everything (EVERYTHING) is not in your control: you are not in control, the world is not in control. Everything will change, and if you attach yourself and your projections to the world, you will suffer.</p>
<p>So is there no way out? No, there IS a way: Four Noble Truths (including the Eightfold Path). That is why Cause and Effect is critical.</p>
