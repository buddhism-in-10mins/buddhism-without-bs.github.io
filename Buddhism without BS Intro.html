<h2 id="a-simple-introduction-to-core-buddhist-principles">A Simple Introduction to Core Buddhist Principles</h2>
<h4 id="buddhism-without-the-bs">Buddhism without the BS</h4>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>I practice Buddhism, and have been practicing for the past 12 years ever since my first meditation retreat with my teacher Ajahn Brahmavamso (commonly known as &quot;Ajahn Brahm&quot;) in 2010.</p>
<p>Over the years, from my own personal study of the Dharma, I have come to the realisation that the core principles of Early Buddhism are increasingly lost in the ever-growing mass of Buddhist teachings in the world. This in turn has created a lot of confusion about what the Buddha actually taught, and we are in danger of losing sight of the core essential teachings of the Buddha.</p>
<p>This is a pity, as we are also now living in a very unique time in history: in the last 10-20 years, we have finally reached a point in time where the different texts from different Buddhist traditions are being compared and analysed in comparison, often for the first time. This is especially true of the Chinese Agamas being compared with the Pali parallels, with the Chinese Agamas being translated into English. This recent comparative analysis has yielded a very rich and interesting understanding of Buddhist teachings, which were previously unavailable. What is striking for me, as an amateur reading these texts, is how modern the Buddha often sounded. And how applicable to modern life!</p>
<p>So this is a single person's effort to bring these core principles to a wider audience, hopefully in a more easily-understood and clear format, without the rituals and mysticism, but also without the over-modernized, frequently-Western-biased carte-blanche rejection that is <em>secular Buddhism</em>.</p>
<h4 id="purpose--objectives">Purpose &amp; Objectives</h4>
<p>The purpose of this work is the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>to provide a free, simple, clear introduction to Buddhist principles, especially for non-Buddhists who are curious to learn the core basics.
<ul>
<li>In line with the Buddha's own teaching, this material is provided for free. Please do NOT re-use this material for your own profit. Please.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>to help beginner Buddhists to learn and retain the core Buddhist principles, which are common across all major Buddhist traditions</li>
<li>to help Buddhists see and apply these principles in their daily lives</li>
</ul>
<p>This is meant to hopefully achieve these longer-term outcomes for the users of this work:</p>
<ul>
<li>A clearer understanding of what are &amp; what aren't core Buddhist principles</li>
<li>Better long-term retention of core Buddhist principles &amp; teachings, which each individual can recall at will</li>
<li>More application of these principles in people's daily lives, to address and reduce their suffering</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="outline">Outline</h4>
<p>The main frameworks for outlining this content are two, and they are arranged in this order:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Noble Eightfold Path
<ul>
<li>Right View -
<ul>
<li>The Four Truths</li>
<li>Cause and Effect</li>
<li>The Five Aggregates</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Right Motivation</li>
<li>Right Speech</li>
<li>Right Action</li>
<li>Right Livelihood</li>
<li>Right Endeavour</li>
<li>Right Mindfulness</li>
<li>Right Stillness</li>
<li>Right View (again)
<ul>
<li>The Four Truths (again)</li>
<li>The Five Aggregates (again)</li>
<li>Dependent Cessation</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Four Truths (within Right View)</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it.</p>
<p>The astute observer might notice that both frameworks seem to refer to each other:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Fourth Noble Truth is the Eightfold Path</li>
<li>The first factor of the Eightfold Path (Right View) in turn contains the Four Noble Truths
The mutual self-referencing might seem circular, but a better way to think of this is to borrow a term from computer science and mathematics: the Four Truths and Eightfold Path are <em>mutually recursive</em>. More on mutual recursion here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_recursion">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_recursion</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="how-each-part-is-structured">How each part is structured</h4>
<p>Each section will be structured the same way:</p>
<ul>
<li>An excerpt from a sutta (with accompanying parallel)</li>
<li>My commentary</li>
<li>Suggested exercises to apply this</li>
<li><a href="https://withorbit.com/">Orbit</a> Prompts</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="how-to-use-this">How to use this</h4>
<p>It is really up to you!</p>
<p>But my suggestion would be the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Read one segment a day</strong>. Don't try to read everything all at one go.</li>
<li>Try one daily exercise.</li>
<li>Answer the Orbit prompts.</li>
<li>Schedule a review of this material every month.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the material really excites you and you want to proceed further, power to you! Please go ahead.</p>
